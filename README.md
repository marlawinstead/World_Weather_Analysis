Deliverable 1

Retreieve Weather Data: For part 1, we gathered data from 2000 coordinates of latitude and longitude. This produced 761 cities from these coordinates. Using the API, we generated latitudes and longitudes, maximum temperature, humidity, cloudiness, wind speed, weather description and country from each of these cities.

Deliverable 2

Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map: For part 2, we narrowed down the results to 208 cities by defining a maximum temperature of 90 and a minimum temperature of 75. 186 of these cities were able to provide a hotel name that the customers could use and book for travelling to their destination.

Devliverable 3

Create a Travel Itinerary Map: For part 3, four cities within close proximity of each other were chosen as an itinerary. These cities are Houston, Houma, Ascension and Morgan City. A travel route was generated using the Google Map Directions API.
